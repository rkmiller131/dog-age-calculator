# Dog Age Calculator

We used to think that every human year equated to 7 dog years, but that was just a guess of of our overall lifespans: on average, humans live to about 70 years old and dogs live to about 10 years old. We now know that dogs age rapidly in their first two years of life, and researchers studying Labradors have fine-tuned the formula even more.
